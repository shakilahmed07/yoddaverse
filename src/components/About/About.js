               <p>
                  It is the year 3033, 9 centuries after the first galactic
                  wars. Human droid inhabitants proceed with the colonization of
                  the first world in the yodda verse “Agatha”. Resources are
                  limited and many droids are racing to collect advanced body
                  parts, military equipment, and look to build bases to deter
                  enemy combatants that may invade their world in the future.
                  Droids are also racing to acquire land on “Agatha” to
                  establish their cities for trade and commerce. The time of the
                  droids have come, and there are many species in the yodda
                  verse that seek to take their lands and replace them. Who will
                  lead them and protect their lands from foreign invaders? If
                  there is a savior out there, that remains to be seen. For Now
                  we are all yoddaOne.
